You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## TO DO - 08/04/25 += DONE 19/04/25

* Enhance Reset password logic- If email do not exist, Error message pop-up {We did not found this email. If you do not have an account, please signup or double check you've insert the right email} -> FIREBASE AUTH SHOULD MANAGE CHANGING PASSWORD --- DO WE WANT THE USER TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE EMAI TOO? ✅ DONE ✅

* Add toggle mode light/dark in child accounts -- Add it in the navbar-next to avatar ✅ DONE ✅

* After Signup redirect on Login --> This is already implemented but currently not working (CHECK)✅

* Create new story with AI or be inspired by AI needs to be implemente as for prototype. 
(AI Story Generator needs to be implemented first) --- UPDATES: DECIDED TO LEAVE ONLY GENERATE BY AI FEATURE AS FOR CLIENT REQUIREMENT! SO, ✅ DONE ✅



## ------ 19/04/25 --- TO DO: += DONE 24/04/25:

* ADD USER ID TO EACH GENERATED STORY [IN THE COLLECTION], SO THAT THE STORY SAVED AND RETRIVED WILL ONLY BE SHOWN IN THE USER ACCOUNT THAT GENERATED IT - AND IN THE LINKED ACCOUNT (CHILD), CURRENTLY EACH STORY GENERATED BY ANY ACCOUNT IS DISPLAYED TO ALL ACCOUNTS.✅

* DELETE CURRENT HARD- CODED STORIES DISPLAYED IN CHILDS ACCOUNT, DISPLAY ACTUAL STORY GENERATED BY PARENT.✅
